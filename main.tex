\section{Bullet points on results}

Biphasic (non-intuitive decrease in product as the total substrate or activating kinase concentration increases)

Context 

-> We focus on the double site multisite since it provides the minimal module required to generate the behavior. We also look at feedback and network interactions on top of this and how this might affect the presence absence and characteristics of any biphasic present.


Result 

-> DSP 
        = There are two different types of biphasic possible in this network (with increasing ATotal and increasing KTotal)

-> Biphasic (with KTotal) is only present when a simple kinetic constraint is satisfied 
        = This expression is only based off catalytic constants 
        = If this expression is satisfied you would definitely get biphasic for some ATotal and PTotal concentration
        = This is also juxtaposed with the constraint enabling multi-stability for the DSP (exact opposite)
        
        = What this means is that the DSP will for any given parameter value definitely give you either multi-stability or biphasic
        
        = This also comes with the caveat that the peak and saturation value will not be dependent on any kind of additional network interaction or feedback/feedforward (shared result with the feedback paper)
            * One thing to confirm is what happens when there is downstream sequestration in some other reaction. 
                
-> Biphasic (with ATotal) is possible for all given kinetic constants 
        = Whether this is possible or not would depend on enzyme totals (ongoing work on how this will decide)
        

-> Separate kinase common Phosphatase (DSP)
        = K2 total will give biphasic 
        = K1 total wont
        
        = Increasing ATotal wont give biphasic

-> Separate kinase separate phosphate (DSP)
        = Won't give any type of biphasic (with KTotal's or otherwise)
        
        
Impact 

=> Characterize remaining DSP landscape (possibility, sufficiency and characteristics of the behavior)
=> Show how biphasic is distinct and intrinsic as compared to say other qualitative behaviors such as multistability
=> How the remaining network interactions can perturb it




Further directions. 

=> When does spatial generate the behavior (particularly compartmentalization).
        - Mainly enzyme
        - But also substrate (maybe?!)
        
=> Can we say something about Isola?
